- run the program using , g++ main.cpp -o main
- then a executable file named main is created run it using ./main command
- enter the path to the desired image (some samples are provided in the repo itself) ex:/home/yourPcname/cplus/sampleImages/sheep.jepg
- a new text file named output.txt is created copy the base 64 code 
- you can test it by pasting the code into the browser but precede it with data:image/jpeg;base64,THE CODE COMES HERE
- you can run it without any changes just by pasting the code to an online decoder
